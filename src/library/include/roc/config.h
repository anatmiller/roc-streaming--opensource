/** Network interface.
 *
 * Interface is a way to access the peer via network.
 *
 * A peer has multiple interfaces, one of each type. The user interconnects peers by
 * binding one of the first peer's interfaces to an URI and then connecting the
 * corresponding second peer's interface to that URI.
 *
 * A URI is represented by \ref roc_endpoint object.
 *
 * The interface defines the type of the communication with the remote peer and the
 * set of protocols (URI schemes) that can be used with this particular interface.
 *
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_AGGREGATE is a high-level interface, aggregating several lower-level
 * interfaces. When an aggragate connection is established, peers negotiate connection
 * parameters and automatically setup lower-level \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_SOURCE and
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_REPAIR interfaces.
 *
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_SOURCE and \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_REPAIR are lower-level
 * unidirectional transport-only interfaces. The first is used to transmit audio stream,
 * and the second is used to transmit redundant repair stream, if FEC is enabled.
 *
 * In most cases, the user needs only \c ROC_INTERFACE_AGGREGATE. The lower-level
 * intarfaces may be useful if an external signaling mechanism is used or for
 * compatibility with third-party software.
